This app was made to record user inputted days with the min temperature and maximum temperature of that day along with weather conditions.
For example:

Monday
Min Temp: 14
Max Temp: 19
Weather Conditions: Sunny

It records the user inputted values for each day and displays them.
The application also displays the average temperature over all the inputted days.
